Windows Admin Center
--------------------

>   You are to use Admin Center to do as many as many of the exercises from
>   Monday to Wednesday as possible. Also very important â€“ use the server core
>   (SVR3) must be administered from Admin Center.  
>   If time permits make SVR3 a Hyper-V host (nested virtualization) and go
>   through the Hyper-V management with Admin Center.

>   When done â€“ do **not** revert virtual machines to Checkpoint.

>   Inspiration on how to accomplish this can be found on:
