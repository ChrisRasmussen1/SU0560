>   **Using Storage Migration Service on Server 2019**

>   In this Workshop, you will test functionality of Storage Migration Service.
>   Use SVR9 as your Orchestrator/Destination server.
>   Use SVR1 as your source server. Use Server Manager or Disk Management to take the offline disks online and create one or more volumes     on these.
>   Use FSUTIL on SVR1 to create files for testing, using the command: fsutil file createnew test1.txt 1000000.
>   Change the values for filename and size to your own values

Storage Migration Service
-------------------------

>   You are to make sure that one virtual member server is running as a file
>   server with shares, permissions and files. Configure another member server
>   as both destination and orchestrator server. Run everything through Windows
>   Admin Center. Test after migration that permissions on shares and file
>   system is correct on destination server.

>   When done â€“ do **not** revert virtual machines to Checkpoint.
